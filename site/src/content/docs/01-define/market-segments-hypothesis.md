## Overall

### Offerings

* No practical details provided
* Disconnected from the assumed goals
* Disconnected from the goals/pains segments express in social media
* Disconnected from concrete benefits 
* Vague, and hand-wavy, lots of word-salads

## Segment Hypothesis

Market segments were define and described by Rawls on ispassociation.org while the qualification and quantification of the segments’ top business problems came from a content analysis of online communities like Reddit.
