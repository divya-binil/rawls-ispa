## Branding and positioning 

Q: What will resonate with prospects and influence them to want to know more?

* Demonstrate that you understand their problems?
* Who is this for?  Me?  Someone else?
* Why am I here?
* Demonstrate a vision for their future, that they want

## Content

### Home Page

* “Core Philosophy” feel into the weeds, and adds noise to the CTAs
* There is no clear indication of that this is or why I should care
* There are some calls to action, but given the ambiguity, these are weak
	* Subscribe, Join, Watch, Learn ... confusing CTAs
* Lots of text, requires reading
* Text is small, hard to read
* Doin’t talk about “maximizing” some metric, quantify how this service maximizes it.
* “Who is This for” is super helpful, but content should be tighter
	* What metrics do they care about?
	* How does this service affect those metrics?
	* What does ISPA know about their member’s customers?
	* Is the solution different for each?
	* Or the benefit they realize?

## Traffic

Q: What are the traffic drivers?
